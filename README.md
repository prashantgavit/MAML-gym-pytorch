## Getting started
To avoid any conflict with your existing Python setup, and to keep this project self-contained, it is suggested to work in a virtual environment with [`virtualenv`](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). To install `virtualenv`:
```
pip install --upgrade virtualenv
```
Create a virtual environment, activate it and install the requirements in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Requirements
 - Python 3.5 or above
 - PyTorch 1.3
 - Gym 0.15

## Usage

#### Training
You can use the [`train.py`](train.py) script in order to run reinforcement learning experiments with MAML. Note that by default, logs are available in [`train.py`](train.py) but **are not** saved (eg. the returns during meta-training). For example, to run the script on HalfCheetah-Vel:
```
python train.py --config configs/maml/halfcheetah-vel.yaml --output-folder maml-halfcheetah-vel --seed 1 --num-workers 8
```

#### Testing
Once you have meta-trained the policy, you can test it on the same environment using [`test.py`](test.py):
```
python test.py --config maml-halfcheetah-vel/config.json --policy maml-halfcheetah-vel/policy.th --output maml-halfcheetah-vel/results.npz --meta-batch-size 20 --num-batches 10  --num-workers 8
```
